# Product People

We mostly secure candidates though our own referenced network, however we also recognise that great talent can exist anywhere. If you really get agile in your bones, operate beyond the frameworks and the methodologies, have experience of leading product management, devops, site reliability engineering or lean enterprise adoption, then we'd love to [hear from you](/about/contact).

We always treat any approaches in the strictest confidence and any information you share with us is not shared with other parties without your permission.

We don't post vacancies or run job ads as a rule, so please understand if we are unable to get back to you immediately. When working on assignments for clients we are typically looking for a relatively narrow range of experience and skills.
