# Services

We are primarily focused on **key talent acquisition**, whether that be for interim
assignments, a programme of change and re-organisation, or leading the charge
on a permanent basis.

We do not body shop. However, as a complimentary service for our retained clients,
we will often recommend individuals in our network for ad hoc positions that fall
outside of our normal business. For example, to staff up a software team with
developers or to find a capable project manager.

We will also utilise our network for **consultancy engagements** such as capability
assessments, to look at features such as organisational readiness, culture, process
and people.
