# Services

We are primarily focused on **key talent acquisition**, whether that be for interim assignments, a programme of change and re-organisation, or leading the charge on a permanent basis.

We do not body shop. However, as a complimentary service for our retained clients, we will often recommend individuals in our network for _ad hoc_ positions that fall outside of our normal business: to staff up a software team with developers or to find a capable engineering manager, for example.

We can also access our network for **consultancy engagements** such as digital transformations or capability assessments to benchmark organisational readiness in culture, process and people.
