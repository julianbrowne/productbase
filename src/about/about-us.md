# About Us

The founders of **product**base have been running retained searches for decades. Our sole mission is finding that one magic individual that not only has the skills, but the personality and cultural fit needed to blend seamlessly into an organisation. We've built and sold a number of companies specialising in niche recruitment. We've put together whole teams for organisations and we've advised board directors on how to address finding new talent, the state of the market, how much to pay and when not to chase the wrong skill set.

We've also on occasion carried out organisational consultancy to benchmark structures against best practice for skill blends, team size, training plans, succession planning etc.
