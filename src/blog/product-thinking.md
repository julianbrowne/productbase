# Product Thinking

First there was the [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/): a revolution in our ability to deliver customer value through software. Agile taught us to take small steps and constantly assess our progress against a sometimes moving target. The benefits were obvious, but the agile manifesto intentionally didn't say anything about how to organise delivery teams in the context of a wider business.

For that, we've historically used the idea of a "project" - a collection of people with a
sometimes unclear mission, a project manager, a budget and usually an ambitious
date to deliver by. It clashed with agile because usually too many things were
fixed too early in the life-cycle, but smart organisations also noticed that
projects tend to clash with each other in obstructive ways: they require the
same people, have cross dependencies on each other, all want to go into 
production at around the same time, fight each other for limited capital investment
budgets and so on.

## Projects are Dead; Long live Products

Organising a delivery portfolio around **products** instead of _[projects](https://hackernoon.com/thinking-beyond-projects-71998e2524e7)_ has
major benefits:

*	**No Dependencies** - the delivery team scope is the whole product, i.e. the
thing that the customer will experience. This means any change on the web site,
back-end, billing system, is owned by the team. No endless meetings about dependencies.

*	**Managed Resource Conflicts** - of course specialist skills may still be
required by multiple teams. But because a team manages their own scope, when they
don't have access to that resource they can work on the next most important thing. 
No more time lost to waiting for people to become free.

*	**Speed** - a team that has a clear mission moves faster. A large problem in
enterprise projects is people join not really knowing what their objective is. Not only does that waste time but it's highly demotivating.

*	**Customer Centric** - what, really, is the most most important thing in any delivery?
The customer, obviously. Some would say sales revenue, and you get that from having more,
or better, customers. Some would say efficiency, and you get the luxury to work on that
if you have revenue from customers. Purpose? (comes from customers). Beat the competition? (steal their customers). It's all, directly or indirectly, about the customer. The problem with projects is it's often hard to work out who the customer is. Or, if it's the _actual_ customer, then many projects don't own enough of the end to end experience to really understand what good looks like. In a product team it's obvious. 

Companies that are mature in the product space are organising around products. And even
creating funding models for them without the usual end of year crunch and squabble to
work out which projects to fund. Strategy becomes easier too because it has to center around
long term targets, the customers and the products they interact with.

## Product People

Roles in product teams are still agile but holistically so. Product developers, analysts, and owners
need to think in very customer-first terms, build requirements around tested hypotheses and
constantly question where the next most valuable feature lies. It's not a direct switch from
project thinking and that's why we at Productbase put so much effort into finding experienced
delivery people who get it.
