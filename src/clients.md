# Clients

## Hive by British Gas

The technology team in Hive has powered our business from launch, meeting the scaling challenges of international expansion, a diversifying product set and maintaining a responsive experience for over a million customers.

Simon was able to secure our Head of Data, Head of Architecture and Head of Security: three critical roles to get right in a modern product-centric agile business. He also filled a number of key positions in our product delivery teams, enabling us to launch Boiler IQ diagnostics and our flagship camera offering. With Simon I typically expect to hire the first or second individual I meet. That's how thorough and in tune with the market he is.

## Jaguar Land Rover

When I arrived as the new CTO at Jaguar Land Rover, I found a team who were very knowledgeable in how their current world operated, but with very little awareness or experience of how modern tools and techniques work.

Simon and his team were able to work flexibly with our corporate resourcing structures and were instrumental in finding a number of Senior Enterprise, Data, Security and Solution Architects who helped drive innovation and were able to inspire the business teams into adopting new capabilities such as the Field Engineer Services Backbone, new Analytics Environments to improve Warranty Claims, and our Digital Twin for Engineering Performance.

## Specsavers

As CIO I've had the responsibility of leading technology teams that have transformed Specsavers, Aviva and HMRC amongst others. Customer and user centric design have all culminated in product centric solutions but that has needed the right sort of talent to deliver such a revolutionary change.

In my experience over the years, very few recruiters truly understand such requirements. But having used Simon and his team for many years, we have resolved that challenge of a new approach and gained the ability to build world class product teams. Consequently iconic products such as taxes on line, iPads in store and total cloud solutions are now helping those enterprises deliver a differentiated customer experience.
