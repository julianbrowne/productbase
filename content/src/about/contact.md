# Contact Us

We mostly secure candidates though our own referenced network, but we also recognise that great talent can exist anywhere. If you really get agile in your bones, operate beyond the frameworks and the methodologies, have experience of leading product management, devops, site reliability engineering or lean enterprise adoption, then we'd love to hear from you.

If you are a company, large or small, interested in securing this kind of scarce talent, then we'd love to explain more about what is it, why it makes a difference to the bottom line and how we operate.
